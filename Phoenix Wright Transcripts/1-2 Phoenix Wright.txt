Uh oh, I'm late. Huh, that's strange. The chief must have gone home already. She said her sister was coming over so we should all go out for dinner... ... What's that smell...? Blood...? Mia! (Maybe she's in her office!)
I smell blood... and that can't be good! I have to check and see if Mia... the Chief's okay!
That smell... Blood!
(Someone's there!) ...! Chief? Chief...?
Chief!!!
Who are you?
(The strange girl dropped out cold. I left her lying on the office sofa. I went back to the chief where she lay under the window. Her body was still warm... I could feel it when I held her shoulder. Then, all too quickly, it began to fade... Until finally she was cold.) Chief...
Some shards of glass are scattered on the floor. They seem to be the remains of a glass light stand.
The chief's chair. A simple, functional design. Feels pretty good to sit in, too.
Chief... It's hard seeing her like this, but if there are any clues here... She was struck on the head with a blunt object. She probably died instantly. "The Thinker" lying next to her must have been the murder weapon.
Hmm... there are some glass shards near the chief's body. Must be pieces of the glass light stand lying broken in the back of the room.
Nothing else that seems like a clue here... Hmm...? A piece of paper! It must have fallen from Mia's hand! What could it be?
It's painful to look... but I have to, for Mia's sake. Looks like she was hit in the head with a blunt weapon. She probably died instantly.
! A word is written in blood on this scrap of paper! "Maya"...? Did Mia write this? This piece of paper is a receipt from a department store, dated yesterday.
(I think that's enough snooping around for now. I'd better call the police... and find out what that girl was doing here.)
It's encrusted with dried blood. How ironic that this became the murder weapon... again.
There's a large building right across from the office. The "Gatewater Hotel." A nice, luxurious place.
All the chief's important documents are packed in here. This is where she filed her case records and recent rulings.
Surprisingly, the chief was never good with machines. About all she used this PC for was e-mail. She picked up this ancient model at some garage sale for practically nothing.
A perfectly normal office desk. The chief had a very particular policy about office décor: "Spend big on stuff the clients use, but keep your own stuff simple."
The Fey & Co. ledger book. Everything is written in the chief's ultra-neat handwriting. It's a small office, but it makes a good bit of money.
Right! I'd better call the police! ...? That's funny... A few of the screws on the receiver are missing... It looks like someone was halfway through taking it apart.
(Wh-what was that!? Someone screaming from outside the window!?) ...! She's staring right at me! She's holding a phone in her hand...
The phone receiver is missing a few screws. I'd better not use it.
...! (That girl just now... where'd she go!? I put her right there on that sofa...! Uh oh... I hope she didn't run on me.) Yipes! (Don't scare me like that...) Umm... Excuse me but, who are you?
It's okay. I work here.
Maya... Fey?
("Maya"...? So Mia was writing this girl's name! Maybe I should show her the receipt? I never thought there'd be a use for evidence like this outside the courtroom!)
You couldn't cram more legal books in here, even if you wanted to. Few can gaze upon the shelves without feeling insignificant.
The door to the chief's office. It's slightly open. I'd better not touch the door knob.
A large painting. I guess you'd call this "modern art." I, on the other hand, call it a mistake.
The reception desk. I usually sit here.
This sofa is for clients. It's leather... a real luxury model.
A small writing desk cluttered with office supplies.
(She seems to be in shock. I don't want to disturb her, but I have to know...) Um... excuse me? Can you tell me what happened?
(So she was already dead.)
So, you're the chief's...?
And you were here... visiting? This late at night?
Evidence...?
Um, about "The Thinker"...
(Hmm, probably shouldn't have asked her about the murder weapon...)
This was lying next to the chief.
Hmm. Maybe. (Never heard of a glass light stand before...)
Before Mia died, she wrote a message with her own blood. She wrote it on the back of this receipt.
Please, just calm down.
(Uh-oh. Now I've done it...)
(I'd better hurry up and call the police!)
! The police! (Sounds like they're coming this way!)
(Gumshoe...? What an odd name.)
(It must have been that woman I saw.)
(Great. Just great. Maya... Wait, she wouldn't have... nah.)
Mia's younger sister, Maya, was arrested on the spot. I was taken in for questioning and didn't get out until the next morning. My eyes were heavy... but I couldn't sleep. I sat around, waiting for visiting hours to begin at the detention center. I had to talk to Maya as soon as possible.
(Wow, they have poor Maya locked up like a criminal.)
Good morning! (She looks so tired...)
Well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about...
(I'd better give it to her straight...) It's up to you.
Yes. I don't think this is something I should decide. After all, you're the one in trouble here.
(First things first, I better get her cheered up...) Yeah, of course I will! Cheer up!
(Whoa! Did I say the wrong thing? She looks sadder now!) Um... what... what's wrong? You don't think I can do it?
(Maybe if I joke a bit she'll cheer up...) Hah hah! No way, Jose! Just kidding...
(Eh heh. Whoops. That didn't go so well.)
Huh? M-Maya...? Was that a... chuckle?
(Not really...)
(Who's trying to cheer up who here!?)
What?
(Did I look at her like that?) No, no! I never thought...
Heard...? Heard what about me?
...
No, it's okay. It's true, I guess. But... at the same time, I can't just sit and watch! When I think of the person who did this to Mia...
Smile for the camera...
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch. A real pro, this guy.
There's something I've been wanting to ask you...
What's with that outfit?
A-acolytes? Like people in religious training? What is it you do?
A s-spirit medium!? (I'm pretty sure that qualifies as strange.)
Could you tell me about the day of the murder?
Evidence?
(The one Larry made...) How could that have been evidence in a case?
H-her own voice!?
You recorded it!
So, you say you have a conversation with your sister on your cell phone? Let's hear it!
Oh, right. (Of course...) Next time I see Detective Gumshoe I'll ask him for it.
Sure, thanks.
Could you tell me about the day of the murder? Sorry... I know it must be hard.
(That's "The Thinker" clock that Larry made. It practically qualifies as a serial murderer by now.) So then, when did you arrive at the office?
Thanks, Maya. That's all I need to hear for now.
So you're an acolyte. A, er, medium-in-training.
Wait a second, you said the "Fey Family"? So, Mia was into this stuff too?
(I... I had no idea.) Hmm... Wait...!
So, you're a real, honest-to-goodness spirit medium? With E.S.P. and all that?
Well, can't you contact Mia's spirit, then? We can just ask her who killed her!
(Hmm... I thought that would be too easy.)
I wanted to ask you about the murder weapon...
(Hmm. Better not ask her about this now.)
This was lying next to the chief's body...
Yeah, that seems about right. (Though I'd never heard of a glass light stand before this...)
Remember that receipt?
Any idea why she...
I trust you.
No, I don't. (It's just a hunch, but...)
...
...
I'm sorry... I don't like lying just to make people feel better. But it doesn't mean that I've decided you did it! (She seemed so lost at the crime scene.)
I wanted to ask you about your cell phone...
(So, Gumshoe took it... I'll have to try to get it back next time I see him...)
Huh? Something the matter?
...?
(Hmm...)
Sure, why not? I'll go ask.
...? Say, what about your parents...?
I... I see. Don't worry, leave it to me.
W-what!? Tomorrow!?
What if this guy refuses!?
I'm sorry... I think this is the kind of thing you should really do yourself.
Something wrong?
They couldn't find him?
...? Say, what about your parents...?
O-okay! Don't worry, I'll go ask him for you.
I'm just worried what will happen if I can't find him.
When will that happen?
(And visiting hours are almost up... I'd better hurry!) Right, I'll be back!
(The office is filled with police officers. They're all busily searching for clues...)
No, no, Phoenix Wright. (How could anyone mistake me for Larry!?)
(He WAS proven innocent...) Umm... right. And you were...
Um... Gumshoe, wasn't it? Dick Gumshoe?
Um... Suedeshoes, wasn't it?
Um... Gumtree, was it? Detective Gumtree?
(Whatever you say, Detective...)
(Whew! He thinks I'm Maya's lawyer...!)
There's a horrendous amount of legal books here. Scarier still is that Mia probably read all of these.
Mia's favorite potted plant. I remember it had this bizarre name no one could ever remember.
(Who was that!?)
Mia's desk. Perfectly clean, as always. The only thing it's missing is... Mia.
An old movie poster. Apparently, this was the first movie that made Mia cry when she saw it. I'll have to check it out one of these days.
The sky is blue, and so am I... There's that hotel, right across the way.
About Ms. Fey... did you do an autopsy?
...
So, Mia's death was instantaneous.
You knew her, Detective?
Um, about Maya...
W-why do you say that?
(Edgeworth...)
Prosecutor Edgeworth...
I know him. He's a feared prosecutor. He doesn't feel pain, he doesn't feel remorse. He won't stop until he gets his "guilty" verdict.
(So, Edgeworth is on this one... He hasn't lost a case since he became prosecutor at the incredibly young age of 20. Of course, there are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...)
Never heard of him.
(Of course I know him... I was just playing dumb. He's a cold, heartless machine who'll do anything to get a "guilty" verdict! There are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...)
(All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion. I never imagined I'd be facing him so soon...)
I was wondering, do you know anything about this?
(Huh? He thinks the clock is just a statue, too... I'm starting to wish I'd never seen this thing.)
There was broken glass at the crime scene, right?
There was a piece of paper next to the victim, wasn't there?
Are you sure that Mia wrote it herself?
(So there's no proof that Mia wrote it.)
I was wondering... did you see Maya Fey's cell phone?
Do you think you could give it back?
(Uh-oh, he's on to me!)
(Hmm... if I tell him why I want it there's no way he'll give it to me!)
Oh, no, it's just... You know, Detective!
That cell phone has a lot of numbers on it... like her boyfriend's... A cell phone holds all a little girl's sweetest and spiciest secrets!
Impressive! You're quite the detective.
(Okay, I can't be straight with this guy... but what should I tell him?)
Oh, no, um... T-that carrying strap on the cell phone...
Yeah, you see that strap is a collector's item... She... was worried it might get lost if it went down to the precinct.
Um. Yes.
(Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation...)
Thanks for this!
(I don't know how I feel, seeing everything written up like this... It makes Mia's death seem so... routine.)
(Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation...)
(I guess I've asked all the questions I need to.)
Um, yes, thank you. I'll be heading out now.
... (Come to think of it, I had completely forgotten about her...) The... witness?
(Well, you just told me her name. Miss May, huh?) So you've sent her home already, then?
(So... she's still in the hotel across the way.) I guess I should know better than to try to get a detective to leak information.
(Time to pay a visit to Miss May!)
(According to the receptionist, the big boss is "out". She couldn't say when he'd be back. It must be hard to keep track of everything when you're a famous lawyer... Not to mention run an office like this. I guess I'll just have to come back later.)
Expensive-looking mahogany bookshelves, filled with expensive-looking books. Hmm... funny... they don't look like they've ever been read.
A solid mahogany desk. The wood's been polished to a deep luster.
That painting has been bugging me ever since I stepped in here. The oil paint is so thick it's practically giving me a stuffed nose. I'm sure the price is nothing to sneeze at either, for that matter.
An expensive potted plant. No idea what kind of plant it is, but it's probably the most expensive one available.
A table for clients. Hmm... an elegant ebony case, and if I'm not mistaken, that lighter's made of solid gold. Even I can tell someone here's got money to burn.
Sorry. I haven't seen him yet.
(Hmm. I'd better go see if I can find this elite lawyer she's talking about.)
What about your family?
(Don't know...? So she could still be alive?)
("Ruined"...?)
... So, you live by yourself?
(I feel bad for her, all by herself up on that mountain...)
So, who was this man who, um, "ruined" your mother?
Wait... they didn't use a spirit medium, did they?
Wow... So, what happened?
You "thought"...?
...!
I see.
Excuse me? White?
White? Hmm...
Hey, I got your cell phone back.
... (Maya's eyes closed... She listened to every word with such intensity... Before long, tears began to roll down her cheeks.) ...
Umm... hi. (Smooth, Wright, real smooth.)
(Memo to self: thank Detective Gumshoe for making my job harder.)
(I pity the lawyer that has to cross-examine this one.)
A simple bed. It's been recently made. Nothing eye-catching here.
The flowers are fake, as expected. I know sunflowers and tulips, but that's about the extent of my floral knowledge.
Ah. A still-scene painting. Wait, should that be "still life"? Whatever. One of those is hanging on the wall.
A bottle and two glasses are on the table. Somebody must be staying with her.
The late summer sunlight streams through the window. There's the Fey & Co. Law Offices building, of course. You can see the inside of the room pretty clearly from here. I think it would be a little difficult to recognize a face from this distance, though.
(There's a screwdriver stuck in this drawer. I wonder what's inside? Let's take a look...)
(Upset!? I thought she was going to explode for a second there! I wonder what could be inside the drawer?)
(Hmm... what's inside I wonder?)
(Maybe later...)
Do you think you could tell me something? I need you to describe what you observed at the time of the incident.
(Umm... *gulp* Better not encourage her.) Er... you know that thing that occur... um... happened the other day? The bad thing? What did you see when it happened? I don't suppose you could tell me about it? Pretty please?
(Oh boy.)
Um, could you... just who exactly are you?
N-n-no! Hey! I'm just doing my job here!
(Believe me, this is the first time in my life I've blushed this much...) Umm... eh heh. Right... can you just tell me what it is you do?
(Oh boy.)
I see there are two glasses on the table. Is someone staying here with you?
Oh, no, not me, I'm, er, just a lawyer!
(Oh boy.)
(Hmm... seems like Mr. Grossberg is out. Well, maybe I should just wait here for him to come back.)
(If that wasn't the most over-the-top clearing of the throat I've ever heard!)
Uh... y-yes, that's me! (He looks even... grander than I imagined!)
Y-yes, well... yes.
(Not busy...? Then how come no one could get in touch with you?)
Um... w-well, sir, actually it's about Maya. Maya Fey.
(Hmm? Why the strange reaction?)
W-wait a second! How did you know the trial was tomorrow!?
(What's going on!? He refused me before I even got a chance to ask him! What do I tell Maya...?)
... (Looks like Detective Gumshoe has gone home. The police are still keeping themselves busy in the chief's office. No one has time to talk to me. Guess I'll head out.)
Mia's favorite potted plant. I guess I'll have to water it now...
Hmm... Maya's not here. She must be in questioning. They probably won't let her out for a while. Maybe I'd better go talk to that lawyer again.
How can you just refuse like that! Please, tell me why you won't take the case!
But the client is Mia Fey's sister!
Mia trusted you... She knew her sister would be in good hands.
Creep. Fine. I don't have time to argue with you anyway. I'll go look elsewhere.
Huh? Did you say something?
Wh-what do you mean?
Why!?
(What's going on here!?)
How did you know Mia Fey...?
A "mission"?
That's... quite a painting.
(I wasn't interested...)
I'm not buying! (Geez!)
Hiya.
Um... well... (What do I tell her?) Well, see... (Just be honest!) I... I really don't think you should use that guy. He... didn't seem healthy. He was all skin and bones!
...
Urp.
... (4:00 PM. Time's up. What should I do? Do I just leave her and go home...?)
(There's nothing left here for me to do... She'll be better off with a state-appointed lawyer.) I think I'd better get home now.
It was a few days later when I found out how the story ended. The result of the trial was in the newspaper. "Guilty." I'll probably never meet her again. Did I make the right choice? Will I ever know? Mia... if you can hear me, please, tell me! ...
Not! I can't let that happen! I'm not leaving here until she takes me as her lawyer!
I've made up my mind! I'm going to defend you whether you want me to or not!
Why? Well...
... (No one is as sad as a person without any friends. I know... I've been there. A long time ago. Why did I become a lawyer in the first place...? Because someone has to look out for the people who have no one on their side.) Maya...
You aren't the culprit! Someone else is!
I, um, I have a hunch... (Given the evidence, it would be easy to assume that Maya was the killer. But there's something about this whole thing that smells... fishy. That witness's strange behavior... was that all an act? And the way that lawyer refused to help out Maya... But more than all that, she has no one left to help her! Nothing is more sad, or more lonely than that. I know... I've been there. A long, long time ago. Why did I become a lawyer in the first place...? Because someone has to
To be honest, I don't know.
(Is this girl sitting in front of me the killer? All the evidence seems to say "yes." But there's something about this whole thing that smells... fishy. That witness's strange behavior... was that all an act? And the way that lawyer refused to help out Maya... But more than all that, she has no one left to help her! Nothing is more sad, or more lonely than that. I know... I've been there. A long, long time ago. Why did I become a lawyer in the first place...? Because someone has to look out for
I won't abandon you. You can count on me.
Well! Let's fight this one and get you out of here!
(Whew, she smiled at last. She looks like an entirely different person!) One last question... You are innocent, right?
It's a deal. (So, what next... There's something that's been bugging me... Just what was inside that strange woman's drawer? It was when I tried to look into the drawer that she got all defensive. There has to be something in there!)
Excuse me, you are...?
Oh, right.
Um... do you know where Miss May might be?
Yeah... Wait... no! Hey! ... (Why does it seem like every time I come here, I end up embarrassing myself? Wait... now's my chance to snoop around a bit!)
Gah! Y-you came back quick!
Oh, right. Sure. (Mr. White... of Bluecorp? Where have I heard that name?)
("White" was the name of the guy who ruined Mia and Maya's mother! Could it be a coincidence?)
There's a screwdriver sticking out of that half-open drawer. Now's my chance to see what's inside! ...! What do we have here! A... wiretap? Hmm! What would a woman like her be doing with a thing like this?
There is definitely something suspicious about this "Miss May"! Why would she have something like this in her hotel room? There's a story behind all this, I know it! Alright... I'll be using this bit of evidence in tomorrow's trial, that's for sure. For Maya's sake... I'll get to this woman's bottom! Wait... I mean ... you know what I mean.
(Uh oh, time to scram! I look forward to tangoing with you tomorrow, Miss May! In court!)
No clues here.
The defense is ready, Your Honor. (Miles Edgeworth... I'd better not show any signs of weakness today, or he'll be on me in an instant.)
(They're still calling it a "statue"...)
Y-yes, Your Honor. (Cross-examine what...? I couldn't see a single contradiction in that testimony...)
(Hey! Maya just threw something at me... What's this? "When my sister couldn't find any contradictions in a witness's testimony she would bluff it and press the witness on every detail! The witness always slips up and says something wrong... It worked lots of times!" Heh... I should have expected Maya would know some of her sister's tricks! Alright. Let's give this a try!)
No, Your Honor. I'd like to begin my cross-examination.
Who did you say you got a call from?
(Hmm... okay, I pressed. Not sure it did much, though.) Right. Please continue.
Detective Gumshoe, how long would you say it took, between you receiving the call, and your arrival at the scene of the crime?
Th-that's pretty fast!
Are you absolutely sure it was us?
(Well... he does have a point about her. She is pretty unmistakable. I should pick my points to press with a little more care...)
Why's that? What's your reason?
Leads to:
Leads to:
(I can't see a single contradiction in there! I'll just have to take Maya's advice and press him on anything suspicious!)
Hold on just one second!
If I heard correctly... You said you arrested her because you had "hard evidence" she did it, correct?
I heard you say it!
Exactly what about this suspicious woman in pink's claim was "hard evidence"!?
(Hmm! I guess pressing can have its advantages!)
(Gah!)
And did you find any evidence?
(I got a bad feeling about this...)
Just because you found it next to the body doesn't mean the victim wrote it!
Wh-who? Um...
Th-the killer! Anyone can see that!
She was framed!
Ah... (Urk!)
(Argh...!)
Well... it could have been the witness, Miss May!
(Argh...!)
It... it could have been me!
No, no, no, I'm just saying it COULD have been me! Can you prove it wasn't?
Uh...
(...!)
Leads to:
Do you have proof it was Mia who wrote that!?
(Uh oh... he sounded pretty confident. This might not be good...)
Leads to:
What kind of "tests" were these again?
(That was a mess...)
Leads to:
On which hand was the bloody finger, Detective?
(Hmm... she WAS right handed...)
(Uh oh... I guess it wasn't too hard to see what I was getting at there.)
Leads to:
Detective Gumshoe! Do you get a lot of cases where the victim actually writes the killer's name?
This isn't a movie, Detective.
Let's talk about reality, shall we?
Don't you find it a little odd that the victim would write down a name? Especially the name of her own sister?
(That didn't go so well...)
Leads to:
(That's his whole testimony... Okay, there has to be a contradiction in there somewhere. Let's find it!)
Detective Gumshoe! There's one thing I want you to clarify for me here. You say that the victim, Mia Fey, wrote this note. That she was accusing the defendant, Maya Fey? That's really what you're saying?
You have it backwards, Detective.
The victim is the only person who absolutely could NOT have written it! This is a report from your department, Detective. "Immediate death due to a blow from a blunt object." She died immediately!
No "but"-ing your way out of this one, Detective!
Wh-when...!?
I... I'm pretty sure it was the day of the murder.
Oh. Right.
It was the day after the murder...
I'm... sorry, I forgot.
Oh. R-right.
Wh-what!?
N-no way!
(Damn you, Edgeworth! I should have known you'd have something up your sleeve!)
Mr. Edgeworth... I've heard there's nothing you won't do to get your verdict... What reason could you possibly have had to request a second autopsy report?
Detective Gumshoe! You're a sham! How could you give me a faulty report!?
Detective Gumshoe. Are you calling me a fool because I believed your report?
(Darn! This isn't good!)
(Exactly what part of her is "innocent"...?)
(This is not good... She's already captured the heart of every man in the court!)
W-wait, Your Honor!
What about my cross-examination!?
H-hey! How dare you!
I'll gladly proceed with the cross-examination. (If only because I have a feeling Edgeworth doesn't want me to! She has to have some weakness!)
No... you're right. I guess there wouldn't be much point.
(Wh-what? That's it!?)
W-wait! Hold on!
Yes yes yes! (I'd better, or I'll lose on the spot!)
Why did you do that?
Why did you look out the window? Were you expecting to see something?
(What? That's it? She can't get out of this question that easily!)
(Well, I have a feeling she's trying to avoid the question! Maybe I should press a little harder on this one?)
(Let's see how far I can run with this...) Surely, you must have had a reason to look out your window at that time of night!
B-badgering?
(Poor girl!? What about poor me!?)
(If I go too deep, I might not come back out alive... I'll back off for now.)
The woman with long hair... that was Mia Fey?
(Your... thing?)
How do you know she was the defendant?
(He's right...)
(Her testimony certainly does make sense... And everyone in the court keeps siding with her. I'd better not press too hard on this one.)
She "dodged"? Dodged what!?
How did you know it was my client!?
(She has a point...)
(Her testimony certainly does make sense... And everyone in the court keeps siding with her. I'd better not press too hard on this one. Maybe I should just listen to the testimony again.)
(Hmm... that's it? Nothing really jumps out as a contradiction... There's got to be something in there somewhere! Maybe I'd better just press her on the facts a bit!)
Hold on a minute! That testimony stinks!
Miss May, I'm willing to bet that...
Did you really see the defendant at all!?
Are you telling the truth? Did you really see the defendant!?
Okay... If you had really witnessed my client, Maya Fey... You would have noticed her clothes before noticing her physique!
No one wears clothes like this on a daily basis! Except her! And I'm no expert on fashion, but her hairdo looks far from normal to me! However, the witness's testimony mentions neither of these things! The testimony is bogus!
She was, Your Honor! I saw her. And so did Detective Gumshoe! What do you say to that, Miss May?
(Damn, I almost had her!)
So, you saw me then, too?
(Spiky...?)
Is that "right" as in your right, as you looked from the hotel?
How convenient for you to remember her "hippie" clothes!
(*sigh*...)
Where did this weapon come from?
A... clock? (Didn't this come up in another testimony recently...?)
(No... but I have a feeling I'm on to something now!)
Leads to:
(Her previous testimony must have been what Edgeworth wanted her to say... So this was the testimony in her own words...? Time to press and squeeze the truth out of her! Figuratively, of course.)
Miss May. What you said just now was quite... revealing.
You just said that this statue of "The Thinker" was a clock. But there's no way of knowing that just by looking at it!
Another person in much the same position as you recently called this a "clock," too... And he was found guilty... of murder!
Miss May. Can you explain how you know this was a clock?
But questions are all I have, Your Honor! And as you may recall, I've caught murderers with these questions before! (Well, only once...)
(Whew, that was close. If he stopped me there, the trial would be over!)
What happens now is you answer my question! How did you know it was a clock?
So, you've been to the law offices of Fey & Co.!
No, Your Honor! (I can't give up now!) I'm not satisfied because...
You were at the hotel! There's no way you could have heard a clock go off in the building next door!
Uh...
Then I would like to propose a test to see if she really could have heard...
Wh-what!? On what grounds?
(Damn! Time to switch directions... quick!)
Your Honor, members of the court... It is inconceivable that the clock in question rang!
That clock is missing its clockwork!
Just have a look... As soon as you can!
See anything interesting, Your Honor?
I-I think it's broken! That clock's busted!
J-just look at it! Your Honor, please examine the clock!
See anything interesting, Your Honor?
The batteries on that clock must be dead!
Your Honor, if you would inspect the clock...!
Well, Your Honor? Are they...?
It is as you can see. The "clock" was empty. It couldn't have rung! Therefore, this witness... is a big, fat liar!
Well, Miss May?
?
(He knew the clock was empty! Somehow... he knew!)
I have proof.
Wasn't it you who told me "proof is everything"? Well, I was listening. And now I'll show you the "proof" you like so much! The evidence that proves when the clockwork was removed is...
Leads to:
What do you say to that?
(Uh oh... I think I blew it.)
S-sorry, Your Honor!
Take a look at this!
W-wait! Wait! This isn't my phone! Listen! This is the defendant's cell phone, and it contains a recording... A recording of a conversation she had with the victim on the day of the murder!
Perhaps Detective Gumshoe overlooked it?
(My heart goes out to you, Edgeworth. Not.) Let's hear the conversation.
Your Honor, I think this recording makes it clear that the clockwork was already gone... and this was recorded in the morning, before the witness even arrived at her hotel!
Well, Miss May? Would you care to explain this to the court? Just how did you know that weapon was a clock!?
Oh right... well, if she had seen it before, I guess... (Wait a second!)
Hold on! P-please wait, Your Honor!
Um, yes, well...
Sorry, Your Honor, it's just...
The witness claims she had "seen it before." But this directly contradicts a piece of evidence already submitted to this court!
Leads to:
Here is undeniable proof!
It's simple. This clock was never in any store, ever!
A friend of mine made that clock. Only two exist in the world. And the one that isn't here is in police custody!
Miss May, I think it's high time you went shopping for a better excuse...?
Oh? Excuses not on sale today?
(S-scary...)
(Okay, this is it!) Yes, Your Honor. Allow me to explain how I see the truth of the matter. Miss April May, you knew the weapon was a clock because...
(This is familiar territory. I'll just use the same approach as with Larry.) Miss May held that very clock in her hands!
When she used it to strike the victim! When else?
April May, you killed Mia Fey, I say! And when you struck, the force of the impact made "The Thinker" ring! That's when you heard it!
W-what's that supposed to mean!?
Oh... (Urk! Of course it wouldn't ring!)
(S-she can't prove it! She did it!)
N-no way!
S-sorry, Your Honor. (That... didn't go so well. But, if that's the case... Then how did she know "The Thinker" was a clock!? ... Wait!) Your Honor, I figured it out! There is one other way Miss April May could have known it was a clock! One way alone! And I have proof!
The defendant's cell phone.
Take another listen to the conversation between the defendant and victim.
Leads to:
(Wait... no, this can't be right! I can't afford any mistakes now!)
Have a look at this.
I found this in Miss May's room.
Miss April May! You used a wiretap to listen to this conversation! That's how you knew "The Thinker" was a clock! Am I wrong!?
Your Honor, look at the witness's face? Does she seem amused to you!? The defense demands an answer.
(That did it! The court's seen the real Miss April May now! Now to deal the final blow!)
Miss May, confess. You did it, didn't you?
Miss May… Why did you tap her phone?
Answer the question!
(Gah! She's saying exactly what Edgeworth wants her to say.) Miss May. You were tapping the victim's phone! I hardly call that "irrelevant"!
Have a look at this.
I found this in Miss May's room.
Miss April May? You were tapping the victim, Ms. Mia Fey's phone, were you not?
Absolutely!
Oh yeah? I THINK I CAN! It's simple!
Here's my proof. The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is...
Leads to:
This! I think...
W-wait! That was just a warm up!
I present the defendant's cell phone.
Listen once more to the conversation between the defendant and the victim.
Miss April May! You used a wiretap to listen to this conversation! That's how you knew "The Thinker" was a clock! Am I wrong!?

This evidence reveals the truth of the matter!
(Uh oh, bad reaction. Maybe that wasn't the thing...)
The witness had never held the clock in her hand! However, she had heard that it was a clock!
That is correct, Your Honor. There is no other way she could have known "The Thinker" was a clock! And I can show you the proof!
The defendant's cell phone.

Miss May!
You killed her, didn't you!
So you admit you tapped her phone!
Really? Can you prove it!? (No way can she prove it!)
You can't be serious! No way!
R-room service!?
I-ice coffee...!?
!
(No! They're going to let her just walk away! There's no way I can win this unless I tie Miss May to the murder somehow...)
Why did you tap her phone?
Answer the question!
(Gah! She's saying exactly what Edgeworth wants her to say.) Miss May. You were tapping the victim's phone! I hardly call that "irrelevant"!

This is my evidence!
Um... "where"? Well, it's not so much a place as a... er...
W-wait! Wait! That was, uh, practice! Here's the real evidence!
Um, well... (Come on, think of something!)
The defense would like to call the hotel bellboy as a witness! There's something suspicious there, and I'm going to get to the bottom of it!
W-why? What's your reason?
...!
Condition...?
(What...!? I'd better find something suspicious in that bellboy's testimony... Otherwise Maya will be declared "guilty" on the spot! What should I do...?)
(Alright! I've got nothing to lose! Except for... well, everything!) Understood. I accept your condition.
(Uh oh!) Uh... um, wait...
(Grr! I can't accept those conditions!) Very well. The defense will refrain from calling the bellboy as a witness.
Right. On with the cross-examination.
(Uh oh! Think! This can't be the end... but I'm out of evidence!)
(What!? B-but that means... Maya's guilty...!?) W-wait! Your Honor!
The defense would like to call the bellboy after all!
...?
(Edgeworth... He's got me backed into a corner... But I don't see any other way to take this!) I accept!
Right. On with the cross-examination.
(Uh oh! Think! This can't be the end... but I'm out of evidence!)
(What!? B-but that means... Maya's guilty...!?) W-wait! Your Honor!
The defense would like to call the bellboy after all!
...?
(Edgeworth... He's got me backed into a corner... But I don't see any other way to take this!) I accept!
R-right! I'm ready. (I hope... This is it... If I can't prove Miss May was involved with the murder now... Maya will be finished!)
What exactly is it you do at the hotel?
Are you always so... so prim?
Are you sure it was Miss May on the phone?
H-how can you be so certain!?
9:00 "on the dot," you say?
(9:00... the time of the murder!)
"Precisely" 9:00, then?
How can you be so sure!?
(Why would she be so particular about the time?)
You are sure it was Miss April May herself?
"Ab-SO-lutely"...?
How come you're so very certain!?
"Embrasser"!? Is that French for "embrace"?
Wh-why would she have done that...?
(Sounds pretty fishy to me... I think our Miss May was up to something and wanted the bellboy to remember her!)
(This bellboy wouldn't have any reason to lie... But I have to find something to use in his testimony! One more time. I'll press him until he spills the beans... or his tea!)
... It's no good! (There's nothing there! Is... is that it!?)
(I can't let this happen... can I?)
(No...! If I give up now, I lose everything... If I just give up the case, I'd be giving up the very reason I became a lawyer!)
W-wait! Please wait!
One last question... let me ask one last question!
(Okay. This is really it, now. This is my last chance! What do I ask him about...!?)
T-tell me about check-in! Tell me about when you checked-in Miss May.
I see... ? Excuse me... what exactly was a "disappointment"?
(...! What did he say!?) What did you say!?
Bellboy! Tell us the truth now... Did Miss May check in with another person?
T-tell me again about er... room service!
I see... ...? E-eighteen dollars? Doesn't that seem a bit expensive?
(...! What did he say!?) What did you say!?
Bellboy! Tell us the truth now... Was someone else staying in Miss May's room?
Bed... bed making! Tell me about making beds that day.
I see. Thank you. ... (Pillows... for two!?) Bellboy! What did you just say?
Bellboy! Tell us the truth now... Was someone else staying in Miss May's room?
Why did you not mention this in your testimony!?
(Nice try!) That's the sort of thing you're normally supposed to mention!
!
I've done it... I've won!
Miss April May checked into a twin room... with a man. Correct?
Then, when you brought them room service, you didn't see that man in the room...?
Your Honor! We have just learned of another person involved who may have been the murderer! In this new light, I hold that it's impossible to judge the defendant. You agree, Mr. Edgeworth?
Simple, it was...
None other than Miss April May!
Oh... right.
S-sorry, Your Honor! Give me one more chance!
It was the bellboy and none other!
Well, s-sure... if you put it that way...
But what if they were in cahoots!
Um... no, Your Honor.
S-sorry, Your Honor! Give me one more chance!
The man who checked in with Miss May!
Your Honor! As has been previously revealed, Miss April May was tapping the victim's phone. Yet Miss May herself has an alibi at the time of the murder. However, that does not clear the man that was with her! The bellboy saw no one else in the room at the time of the murder!!!
"Too late"? I suppose you'd like it if it was too late, wouldn't you... After all, it was you who hid the presence of the other man from this court!
R-really?
Oh, I was just "doing my job" you know... heh heh.
Huh?
Hmm... if you say so.
Well, no. I don't think so. Not yet.
But I got a great lead in today's trial!
That man with Miss May! He's the key!
I heard they arrested her. I guess she's learning her charms won't work everywhere. She's probably at the detention center now. I may have to go down there later. Anyway. This case is far from closed.
I'm going to find out more about this man.
Maybe so.
Don't worry, I'll find him by tomorrow. I promise.
I asked for a full record of April May's testimony. I thought it might come in handy during the trial tomorrow. But now that I have it, I'm not so sure. Most of her testimony was all lies... In fact, there's only one part that got left on the record.
I don't know how much good this will do me at all, now. Anyway, time to hit the pavement and do some investigating! Maya doesn't belong in that detention center, and it's up to me to get her free!
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Huh? Really?
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
They aren't, are they...
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
(Ugh. I must be on the wrong track?)
No, not really, there's something I wanted to ask.
(Here we go again...) Please, you're scaring the security guard.
(For starters, how did you get to be so totally whacked!?)
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch. A real pro, this guy. Or maybe he just doesn't get to see a lot of women like Miss May in here.
About the man who stayed with you in your hotel room...
Can you tell me about him? Where is he? C'mon...
(Hmm... maybe if I had something to get her to talk...)
Why did you place a wiretap on Mia's phone?
Um... tapping people's phones is a crime, Miss May.
(This woman is impossible to talk to...)
Say... Why are you so... angry? I mean, you don't look like a bad person...
B-bottom...? (I can't tell, does she have a thing against lawyers... or just against me?)
(Thanks, I noticed.)
Looks like forensics is taking the day off today. Detective Gumshoe's nowhere in sight. The police really gave this place a working over. I doubt there are any valuable clues left. Suppose it can't hurt to take a look around, though.
You couldn't cram more legal books in here, even if you wanted to. All the cases that the chief worked on are filed here. Hmm. Are some of the files missing...? Nah, I'm imagining things.
(Huh. Looks like Grossberg is out today... again. Maybe he's avoiding me for some reason?)
What's this? Old photos? There are two lying here. Something's been written in pencil on the backs. "DL-6 Incident - Exhibit A," "DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B"... Let's take a look at these...
... I'm sure I've seen this person somewhere... Perhaps I'll borrow this photo. I'm sure no one will miss just one little photo. And it might be a valuable clue... I'll take it for now.
Why would Grossberg have a picture of this man...? This might be a valuable clue... I'll take it for now. I'm just borrowing it. I'll return it later.
I don't need it now, whatever it is. If I ever run out of clues, I'll know where to find these. (Although I can't be sure the photos will still be here then...)
A photo lies on the desk. Maybe I should switch it with the one I took?
I think I'll swap them...
No, on second thought, I'd better not.
Wait a second... Wasn't there a giant painting hanging on that wall...? Yeah... yeah, it was a painting of...
Wasn't it? It wasn't a very memorable painting, anyhow.
Hey, the only reason I'm back here is because YOU won't talk to me!
(That does it. When this case is done I'm shaving my head.)
About the man who stayed with you in your hotel room... Can you tell me about him? Where is he?
Look, he's being accused of murder! I don't think you want to be protecting him.
No.
(Damn! Hmm... maybe if I had something to get her to talk...)
Any thoughts about this photograph?
(... *sigh* Looks like I've just been wasting my time.)
Have a look at this.
(Ah hah! A reaction!) This is him, isn't it?
It IS him. This is the man who stayed in your hotel room the night of the murder!
(Nice try, Miss Cooperative.)
(I'm so close!)
Oh, um, thanks. Sorry for putting you on the spot like that.
Huh? "Rep"?
Whoa, whoa! Miss May hasn't been charged with murder.
(Why do I feel like we're both stuck in the same bad dream...)
A vase, as expected. I'm not good with flower names, except maybe tulips and sunflowers.
Huh? There's still a screwdriver stuck in that drawer!
(This guy's serious! I don't believe it...)
A bottle and two glasses rest on the table. Why hasn't he cleaned these up by now?
Nice weather again today. I can see the Fey & Co. Law Offices, of course.
...
(By that look in his eyes I'd say he was more than serious...)
About Miss May...
(Do WHAT!? I'm starting to think the most suspicious person here is this guy!)
I wanted to ask you about the man who was with Miss May...?
(There we are in total agreement, Mr. Psycho Bellboy.)
(A photo. Hmm...)
Could you tell me about this hotel?
A subtitle!?
Um... sounds great! (Whatever floats your tea set...)
What about this photo?
(Oh... yeah. Right.)
Take a look at this photo.
Um... I'm the lawyer.
(No. No I don't.)
An affidavit? (This guy is way too excited about this...)
Well thanks, but I don't think that will be necessary.
Well, sure. Why not?
Just hurry up and write it.
(Not even Miss May can play dumb to this!)
Sorry to press the matter, but are you sure this is him?
Umm... thanks.
Thanks for this.
(Why do I sense an unhealthy level of excitement behind that unchanging smile? His tea set is rattling!)
(*sigh* He's out again? Huh? No more photos on the desk...)
How about this photograph?
Could you have a look at this?
The bellboy's affidavit! He told us everything he saw. He told us about the man you checked in with. He told us who he was.
(Now I'm getting somewhere!)
(Okay, okay... she's vulnerable now. I should be gentle.) Miss May... It would be easy for me to hand this affidavit to the police.
If they get involved, wouldn't your boss be even more... er... inconvenienced? All I want to do is have a little chat with him. You won't tell me?
Yes.
(Show them a little kindness and they jump all over you! That had the opposite effect to what I hoped...)
(This isn't working... I think I've worn out this piece of paper's usefulness.) Dammit!
(The man in this photo is the one I want! Why did April May not want to talk about it... she must know him!)
(This is it, all or nothing! Time to do a little bluff.) No use playing dumb! (If, indeed, that's an act.) If you don't talk, I'm taking this photo to the press!
Even though he should be a witness to murder, this man is in hiding. I'm sure the press would have a field day with his reputation!
(Yes! Man, that felt good! It's great to be alive!)
*cough* Now, tell me about the man you were with.
(Redd... White?) "Information gathering?"
Hmm... So this is the man that was with you the night of the murder?
(...!) It's okay, I'll just ask Mr. White himself.
Can you tell me where Bluecorp is located?
(Mr. Redd White, at last! Finally, a lead on this guy! If April May couldn't have done it, that leaves him! Time to take action!)
Hmm. The bellboy seems to be out. Huh? The sound of water coming from the shower...
Someone seems to enjoy washing the showers.
The screwdriver is still stuck in the drawer. I'd better not touch it. No telling what the bellboy would do to me.
A bottle and two glasses rest on the table. I'd better not touch them. No telling what the bellboy would do to me.
(Alright, this is getting ridiculous. Where the heck is that loafer?)
(Ah, that old familiar clearing of the throat...)
Um, hello, Mr. Grossberg.
Excuse me...?
(He was there...?)
(I guess something got passed down through Mia... maybe?)
?
(I appreciate the reminiscing, but I'd much rather you gave me some information!)
So you came to see the trial?
Really? What was that?
(If you were that worried about it, why didn't you offer to defend her!?)
I asked before, but, why did you refuse her request for defense? I think I have a right to know.
... (He does seem troubled about something... Maybe I can find something that will inspire him to talk.)
The other day I'm sure there was a big, pretentious-looking painting on that wall...
Well... you know the one I mean. Anyway, where did it go?
(Sold it!? I'm not sure I buy that...) Wasn't that painting rather important to you, sir? Did something happen?
Mr. Grossberg...?
(He barely even glanced in my direction...)
Excuse me, I was wondering about this photograph...
I borrowed it.
Mr. Grossberg. Tell me about the man in this photo. He may have been in that hotel room with April May on the night of the murder. Do you know something about him... anything?
I follow.
(Redd White... Hmm.) Bluecorp... they're something like a detective agency, right?
(Hmm... selling information. Sounds like blackmail.) Can you tell me where Bluecorp is located?
(Mr. Redd White, at last! Finally, a lead on this guy! Even if April May couldn't have done it, he could have! Time to take action!)
I'm sorry to have taken it without your knowledge. But... I have to know. Who is this man? He was most likely in April May's room the night of the murder.
(What has him so flustered I wonder...?)
(...! He's fallen silent as a stone. A rather large stone. I guess I should return that photo.)
... (What's with the surreal décor...?)
(What the...?)
Uh... Wright. Phoenix Wright. ("Inquirably"...?)
(What is this guy's problem!)
(What a fruitcake!)
(What does he mean by that?)
(Yipes! This guy's arrogance meter is off the scale!)
I'm guessing this is supposed to be a desk? My my... This is quite the... thing.
...? Haven't I seen this somewhere...? Is this a replica?
Hmmm...
A statue of a man holding up the world. The "Bluecorp" sign certainly stands out enough... The model for the man is, of course, Mr. White.
(I think it's a little too "beautacious" for just about anyone to appreciate.)
An impressive line-up of trophies. "Judges Special Runner-up" "Best Participation" "Judges Cooperation Award" "Special Good Try Prize" Hmm. The words "Judges" and "Special" kind of stand out.
This is the top floor of a 20-story building. The view is quite... presidential.
Miss May is an employee of Bluecorp, is she not?
"What she has done"... You mean the wiretap?
(It sounds like he's trying to turn Miss May into a scapegoat...)
On the night of the murder were you in April May's hotel room?
Still, Mr. White... The hotel bellboy has stated on the record that he does remember you very clearly.
(Hmm. He raises a good question, actually... Why didn't prosecution call him as a witness? He should have "seen" the same thing as April May!)
What kind of company is Bluecorp, anyway?
(Sell... information?)
Uh... there's something that's been bothering me.
That big painting on the wall over there...
It's a very striking piece of art.
Yeah. ... (Why am I making small talk...?)
You know, I've actually seen that painting before.
Just yesterday, actually.
My point is simple. Er, rather, my question is simple: Why is that painting hanging on your wall?
Say, when did you get that painting?
I've seen that painting before. Yesterday, in fact. Why do I find that painting here today?
About this wiretap...
She testified that she placed the wiretap at your request.
(I'm going to need hard evidence to get anything out of this guy...)
About this picture...
The hotel bellboy says he saw this man on the night of the murder.
Wright.
Umm... huh? A lawyer?
(Wh-what!?) Ungh! Oof...! Unh... uhhh... (He... he punched me!)
What...?
(So you say... But I wonder... Is that kind of control really possible?)
Mr. Grossberg's... yes.
I'm guessing this is supposed to be a desk? My my... This is quite the... thing.
This painting was, until yesterday, hanging in Mr. Grossberg's office. Why does White have it now? It's not hard to imagine a few possibilities.
A statue of a man holding up the world. The "Bluecorp" sign certainly stands out enough... The model for the man is, of course, Mr. White.
An impressive line-up of trophies. "Judges Special Runner-up" "Best Participation" "Judges Cooperation Award" "Special Good Try Prize" Hmm. The words "Judges" and "Special" kind of stand out. He probably strong-armed them into giving him something.
Apparently, Miss May is in questioning. I doubt they'll let me talk to her today.
(Huh? I don't think he's noticed me standing here. Maybe I should... clear my throat?) Aaa-HHHEM!
What's wrong? You looked so pensive... like an old man at the end of his days.
(Something's really bothering him, that much is clear.)
So you came to see the trial?
Really? What was that?
I asked before, but, why did you refuse her request for defense? I think I have a right to know.
... (He does seem troubled about something... I'm starting to have a feeling I know what it is.)
So, I paid Bluecorp a visit.
Mr. Grossberg... I have to admit, something has been bothering me.
You see, it's just...
Mr. Grossberg, sir... There was a giant painting hanging right there the other day, was there not? The one you said you had "no intention of parting with"? Well, I saw it. Today. It was in the CEO's office at Bluecorp. Redd White's office.
Mr. Grossberg, I know you and Mr. White are connected somehow!
Yes! And I know what it is...
You're his client, aren't you? He's giving you information!
You've been protecting him all along. You protect him because you need his services!
You gave him that painting in exchange for some valuable information, didn't you?
(Huh? Did I get it wrong?)
Mr. White has something on you doesn't he? Blackmail?
I think that painting is fairly gaudy proof.
(What's he talking about...?)
It's not something I can claim to understand... But you and Mr. White are lovers, aren't you!
You sent that painting to him! As a sign! A sign of undying love!
I... I don't understand how you could...
(I knew it! They are lovers!)
That photo of Mr. White... Why would you have his photo, Mr. Grossberg?
A long time ago? I'm sorry... but I think not. I think you still have ties to Mr. White even today.
It's pretty straightforward, actually...
You go drinking together! You're friends, aren't you?
(Huh? Whoops... maybe that wasn't it.)
Mr. White has something on you doesn't he? Blackmail?
Mr. Grossberg, sir... There was a giant painting hanging right there the other day, was there not? The one you said you had "no intention of parting with"? Well, I saw it. Today. It was in the CEO's office at Bluecorp. Redd White's office.
Mr. Grossberg... tell me what happened.
Redd White is supplying you with information, obviously!
You've been protecting him all along. You protect him because you need his services!
(Huh? Whoops... maybe that wasn't it.)
I thought it was strange. Here was Maya, your own apprentice's little sister, in desperate need... Accused of killing her own sister no less, and you wouldn't take the case! I finally realized why. You and Redd White are connected. He's...
I'll bet you and White go way back! He's your boss now, and was before, I bet!
Yeah! You both have that sort of "we're in the same club together" feel to you.
(What does he mean... "sense of humor"? I was serious!)
Mr. White has something on you doesn't he? Blackmail?
Mr. Grossberg, sir... There was a giant painting hanging right there the other day, was there not? The one you said you had "no intention of parting with"? Well, I saw it. Today. It was in the CEO's office at Bluecorp. Redd White's office.
Mr. Grossberg... tell me what happened.
It's not something I can claim to understand... But you and Mr. White are lovers, aren't you!
Mr. Grossberg. The other day, there was a giant painting hanging on that wall. I saw that painting again, today. It was in the CEO's office of Bluecorp. It was a present, wasn't it?
I... I don't understand how you could...
(Hmm... I guess I was wrong. But it just seemed so right!)
(15 years...!)
(The name on the back of those photographs!)
(So that's the connection!)
Impossible? Why!?
What!?
What is the "DL-6 Incident"?
(A medium...?)
(Fey!)
(This is what Maya was talking about the other day!)
But why were you blackmailed over this, Mr. Grossberg?
You told White?
... I see.
Mia's office...?
It's funny, looking at this room, it seems... so normal. Hard to imagine a murder took place here. Mr. Grossberg said there would be clues... Maybe I should have another look.
All the cases the chief ever worked on are filed here. They're in alphabetical order. Let's take a look... Which file should I look at...?
Let's see if there's "A" record in this file that catches my "I." "A"... "B"... "F"! "Misty Fey." That's Mia and Maya's mother. Hmmm... Should I take a look?
Hmm. The record stops there. ... So Mia knew Grossberg...
I don't think it has much to do with the current case. I'd be interested to know what it contains... but I'll leave it alone for now.
Let's see... "J" through "S"... Nothing much in here. Maybe I'll just skim some of this?
Nah... this is taking too long. Later. *yawn* I've never been good at reading these things.
"T"... "U"... I know, "W"! "White"! ... ! The entire "W" section is missing! Was it taken...?
*sigh* Well, no harm in flipping through a bit, I guess... The biggest part's here at the end in "S"... "Suicide"? Eww... She has a collection of suicide reports. There's politicians... policemen... ... ...! There's writing on most of these in pencil. "White"...? This is Mia's handwriting. Wait, I get it! Mia thought he was involved in these "suicides"! White drove them all to... ... I can use these newspaper clippings. Hmm... let's find the most disturbing one...
Shall I check Mia's files once more?
Which file to check?
Hmm... not much in the "J-S" section. I'm not sure reading suicide accounts will be very good for my mood... I think that's enough reading for today.
I don't see much point in checking files that are missing all the key parts. *yawn* I give up.
I found this in Mia's files...
(Not a bad idea...)
Sorry, but there's something I have to ask you.
(Transparent...)
(I think we're past needing to talk about April May. I've got to put this guy on the spot, and quick!)
(This guy is a pro at pulling the wool over people's eyes. I've got to put him on the spot, and quick!)
(There's no point asking someone this crooked a straight question! I need some evidence I can use as ammo...)
(This is the only clue that Mia left me... I'd better make this one count!) Mr. White... see this? It's an article describing the suicide of a politician.
He was embezzling secret government funds. Then, one day, word got leaked to the press. The very next day he took his own life.
I found this article in Mia's office.
She had a file filled with articles like this. Every one of them was labeled with a single word... "White."
Mr. White, I know what you did to this politician.
You bribed him!
(Um... gee, that's a good question. I guess I got ahead of myself there...)
(Dammit!)
You were spying on him, weren't you?
You snooped on him, and found out about the embezzlement. Then, when you revealed it, he was driven to suicide!
(Gah! This guy's as cool as a cucumber...!)
You were blackmailing him!
Not just him, either. You were threatening and coercing hundreds of others! You were involved in all of the suicide cases that Mia investigated! This company is built on blackmail! I'm right, aren't I?
Wait a second, Mr. White...
You are absolutely right. I should be looking for the killer now. And actually, I've done better. I've found him. He's sitting right in front of me.
You're wrong, Mr. White.
What I should be doing now is going after you!
Mia was on to you. She was keeping tabs. For this reason you had April May tapping her phone. Then, Mia was murdered, and all the documents about you mysteriously disappeared. So, the culprit would be...?
Even a child could work it out, Mr. White. You did it!
What!?
How dare you!
(I... I feel faint.)
Wright, actually. Phoenix Wright. And my friend's name is "Larry"...
I can't believe it's only been a day since the first trial. My trial begins tomorrow. White's going to set a trap for me. And the prosecution will be in on it, of course. Edgeworth, included. An attorney was assigned to me by the state, yesterday. I refused. I had an idea.
Oh, Maya! Great, they let you out of detention.
Hah. Now I'm afraid we've switched places.
I explained what had happened to Maya. ...
Um... well...
Alright, you can be my defense lawyer tomorrow!
Huh?
(Wasn't it E.S.P. that ran in your blood...?)
Well, you could cheer for me in court.
Huh? Um, yeah, like that.
Huh?
Right. Okay, listen up. I want you to help me break out of here!
Yeah. Tonight's our only chance!
Huh?
... W-wait. Wait wait wait.
I'm kidding! It was a joke!
No really, I was kidding. But thanks. It's good to know you're on my side. (And there really isn't anything you can do for me anyway...)
(Just a piece...?) Okay. Then, come to the court tomorrow.
It's the beginning of a new century, yet with crime it's the same old story. In fact, it's gotten worse. Lengthy court proceedings are no longer realistic. Beginning a few years ago, a limit of three days was put on initial court trials. Almost all finish in a day. Most with a guilty verdict. I never thought I would end up in the defendant's chair myself. Tomorrow the true culprit will appear as a witness. This is it! It's me or him!
No clues here.
Yeah. One way or another, this case gets decided today.
(...! Prosecutor... Edgeworth.)
?
(What, does White have the judge in his pocket, too!?) So... you're saying I'm going to be guilty. End of story?
Edgeworth... You've changed.
Well... court will be opening for session soon.
I'll be defending myself.
Okay, let's do this.
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
Yes, Your Honor. I will be defending myself.
(That went far too smoothly! Why didn't the judge ask Edgeworth why his witness didn't testify before!? It's like... it's like he already knows why! Hmm. If anyone's going to raise an objection about this, I suppose it's me...)
Mr. Edgeworth, you owe an explanation to the court! Why didn't this witness testify in the trial against Ms. Maya Fey!?
(Great. He gets to show off and I get nowhere.)
(Forget it. I smell a trap.)
(These two are great together...)
(If I can't rip this guy's testimony apart, I'm done for. Why do I always feel like it's the end of the world and I'm the last man standing?)
...!
Yes, Your Honor.
How do you know what time it was?
No no no, you're not getting away with that!
(Hmm. That's what Miss May said, too.)
True, the bellboy who brought the coffee saw Miss May. But he testified that he did not see you at the time!
(Hmm...)
(I don't see anything to gain by attacking him on this point any further.) Okay, what were you doing at the time?
By window, you mean the one directly across from the Fey & Co. Law Office?
And there you were reading... papers?
A "bedlam"?
So you were reading your papers until you heard that sound?
(No snoop? Yeah, right! You've made a career out of snooping!)
S-spiky-haired!?
What you just said directly conflicts with Miss May's testimony! Miss May clearly stated that the assailant looked like a "girl"!
Just what is your eyesight?
40!? Don't add them together!
(Hey, whose side is the judge on, anyway?)
What was Miss May doing at that time?
Did you know she had been tapping the Fey office phone?
You'd make a good politician, Mr. White.
Can you be a little more detailed about that? I think it's worth knowing exactly what happened.
Are you sure about that?
(How many times must I hear that?)
Leads to:
Um... "impaction"? Don't you mean just "impact"?
(On second thought, perhaps I'd better leave the whole language thing alone...)
(Did Edgeworth "prep" this guy, too, I wonder? Anyway, I'd better find a weakness in there...)
Wait right there! Mr. White, you've dug your own grave!
You said the victim ran to the "left." But that directly contradicts Miss May's testimony! She clearly stated that the victim ran "right"!
I think not. Look at the floor plans... The killer was here. And the victim, here. If the victim ran to the left, as you claim she did... She would have been running directly away from the door! She would have been running into a dead end! Don't you find that odd?
True. (Maybe he really did see the victim run left...? So he did witness the killing...? Wait a second!)
Yes, Your Honor?
As Mr. White testified, Mia ran to the left.
She did not. She was running towards the door, Your Honor.
Not at all.
As Miss May has stated, Mia ran to the right after she was attacked.
Then there can be only one explanation.
Both witnesses are telling the truth. (For once...)
There is one scenario that would explain their conflicting accounts.
Obviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!
In the law offices of Fey & Co., of course! More specifically, he was standing here! (Show the court where Mr. White was standing!)
Leads to:
That's where he was!
(Oh... oh, right!)
Sorry, Your Honor! Sorry! Let me try that again...
That's where he was!
S-sorry! Er... let me try that again!
This is where he was! Look! When the victim ran for the door... If he was watching from this point, to him it would appear that she ran to the "left."
(What now!? He's... laughing!?)
(Good luck. You can't fix a broken testimony, buddy!)
You bet I will! I mean, yes, Your Honor.
What do you mean by that!
(Hey buddy, you're an American, too!)
What do you mean "first"?
I didn't hit anyone!
I'm not hiding anything!
(Why's he mad at me!?)
What do you mean "next"!?
I know that!
Leads to:
Stop saying it was me!
(Argh! Can I do nothing right? Nothing!?)
Leads to:
So each of you saw different parts...?
(Where did he pick up that annoying phrase...?)
Leads to:
So were you watching both times?
Leads to:
I think we've got him right where we want him! He slipped! Let him laugh for now. I'll soon wipe that smile off his face!
Mr. White! The victim died from a "single" blow!
What do you have to say to that?
(Now's my chance to hit him where it counts!) Mr. White. Wasn't it you who told this court you were "abso-posi-lutely perfect"?
Your Honor, if you could ask the witness for a new testimony...
The witness is confused because he's lying! I emphatically request that there be no break, Your Honor!
(The crowd's on my side! No slipping out of this now, White!)
Deal with it. This is almost over.
You heard "that thing fall"? What exactly was "that thing"?
(Right... the one that had fallen over at the scene.)
Huh? No, not really. Please continue your cross-examination.
(Yeah, that is odd. I'll press further.) Mr. White.
You're saying you saw the glass light stand?
Then change your testimony to reflect that!
The "glass stand was lying on the floor"? That's the first I've heard of this. Why didn't you tell us about the stand before?
(White's falling apart.)
Yes, Your Honor. (Edgeworth is on the ropes!)
Mr. White. It was impossible for you to have seen the light stand!
The stand broke into pieces when it fell!
Just by seeing the broken pieces you would have no idea it was a light stand! So tell me, exactly when was it that you saw the stand? Answer the question!
So... you saw the stand before the victim was attacked, then?
(Hmm...)
Right. I guess there isn't a problem.
Huh? What?
Yeah, I guess so.
Huh...? Why not?
... Oh!
Sorry, Your Honor! I guess there is a problemo, er, I mean, a problem.
Sorry, Your Honor. But, I have proof!
There's a big problemo, er, I mean problem here.
Mr. White, let me make sure I have this straight... You saw the glass light stand through the window, from the hotel... before the incident occurred?
No, it's impossible! You couldn't have seen the stand!
I sure do, Your Honor!
A person in the hotel could not have seen the stand before it fell over!
Leads to:
This is the proof! ...
N-no... it's just...
(I don't think so either.)
I'm sorry, Your Honor. Let me try that again.
Mr. White. It was impossible for you to have seen the glass stand!
"Miss Mia"...? Mr. White, did you know the victim personally?
(You're looking a little flustered, Edgeworth!)
Now before, you said that she was hit before she ran.
What did you do then?
"Thwap"...? That doesn't sound like the "savage" attack from your earlier testimony...
He's probably afraid I'll catch him on something! (But it won't be easy!)
Look at this!
Correct, Your Honor. Now, look... If you were to look through the window at the office... This is the area you would be able to see! Here! Well...? Note that the stand is not within the visible area! Well, Mr. White! What do you have to say to that!?
Mr. White. If you were in the Gatewater hotel as you claim, you could not have seen the stand before it fell over! In fact, you wouldn't have been able to see it after it fell, either! There's no way you could have recognized the broken shards as a glass light stand! So, when did you see the stand, Mr. White? It must have been the moment that it fell! And the only place you could have seen that from... is inside the Fey Law Offices! In other words, you were at the scene of the crime, when the
Mr. White.
You did it, didn't you?
(Heh. Looks like we're about to get our verdict!)
W-what!? (Urk! I forgot about Edgeworth!)
The w-wiretap!?
(I really don't like the way this is headed...)
No! You wouldn't!
Give me a break!
(I... I feel faint.)
(Gah! What am I supposed to do now...!?)
D-do you have proof!?
Huh... right.
Was it really you that went into the office? Or was it Miss May?
(And if I know Edgeworth, he's already run a check on those prints...)
Why did you tap Mia's phone!?
Why did you notice something as innocuous as a light stand!?
(Dammit! There's nothing there for me to press him on! Oh well... maybe he's rattled enough that I can bluff something out of him!)
(Uh oh! Don't tell me I've run out of ammo!)
(No more... I can't take this anymore...)
... Y-yes, Your Honor.
...?
(I know that voice! ... M-Mia!?)
...!!!! M-M-Mia...!
Where... Where am I? The waiting lobby...? What happened? ... Oh, right... I lost the trial. I was... hallucinating. ...
Gak!
Y-You're... M-Maya...?
So... Maya is channeling you, Mia?
...! B-but!
Huh...?
Um... oh, yeah! The one you wrote "Maya" on...?
So... so what do I do with it?
The... front? (It's a regular receipt... Looks like it's from a famous department store. "$1,000.00"... wow, big spender! "Item"... "glass light stand"...! "Date of purchase"... "September 4"...) ...! September 4!
Whoa!
He said he saw the stand the week before the murder!
Right!
Yes. Sorry, Your Honor. I'm fine now.
Your Honor! Please, give me one more chance. I promise you, this is the last time I'll ask you!
Do you have proof!?
Huh... right. (Gah! I have to show him the evidence Mia gave me!)
Leads to:
Was it really you that went into the office? Or was it Miss May?
(Gah! I have to show him the evidence Mia gave me!)
Leads to:
Why did you tap Mia's phone!?
(Right! I have to show him the evidence Mia gave me!)
Leads to:
Why did you notice something as innocuous as a light stand!?
Leads to:
(Now I've just got to show him the proof Mia gave me!)
Look closely at this. See the word "Maya" written in blood...?
I think not. Look at the other side of the receipt.
Your Honor. Would you tell the court what is written on the other side of that receipt?
You see! Mr. White. When you allegedly entered Fey & Co. Law Offices at the beginning of September... The stand could not have been there!
Well, Mr. White? Can't get out of this one, can you?
(Uh oh... he's losing it.) ... Well, Your Honor. I understand there must be quite a bit of PRESSURE on you. But I think you'll agree you can't judge me "guilty" under these circumstances.
Eh? (What! No way he can worm his way out of this one! Oh wait... I forgot. It's Edgeworth.)
(...!)
(Another inquiry...!? This isn't going to be another one of those "updated autopsy reports"! This guy just makes up evidence as he pleases! This is bad...!)
Mr. White's guilt is obvious! There is no need to prolong this trial any further!
Whaaaat!
(Hmm. I don't know where he's going with this. I'd better hold back for now.)
(Uh oh...)
(No! There's no telling what will happen if I can't end this now! Edgeworth is sure to come up with--or just make up--something! And after Mia showed up to help me and all...)
(Gah!)
(M-Mia...!)
Mia? What's this...?
Your Honor. If I may...?
(You bet I am! My life is riding on this one!) I have something I would like to read to the court!
Leads to:
(No... that's not it! I can't mess this one up!)
N-no, Your Honor!
The memo Mia had given me was a list of names. Many of them sounded strangely familiar. People in finance, famous celebrities... That's when it happened.
Yes, Your Honor.
Yes, Your Honor. I guess you could say that. (If only you knew how "spirit"-ed it was!)
I'm lucky I had both you and Maya on my side.
(As long as you "live"...?)
Huh?
W-what!? No! There's still so much to say!
Ch-Chief!
The office...?
Chief... Mia!
(Being here, it's hard not to think about that night...)
Mia...
Huh? Of course I came...
M-Mia...?
Mia!
M-Maya...?
(Look like... you WERE her!)
Uhm, Maya... Why are you here?
Take care of... huh?
("Nick"...?)
You know, when I think about it... It is Maya's fault I'm here now. But... If it wasn't for her I'd probably be in jail! "Wright & Co. Law Offices." It's got a good ring to it. Yeah! Thanks, Maya!
Huh? Do... what?
O-okay! Wait up!
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Huh? Really?
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
They aren't, are they...
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
(Ugh. I must be on the wrong track?)
