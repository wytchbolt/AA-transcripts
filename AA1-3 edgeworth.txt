The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.
The prosecution will show the court that at 2:30 PM on October 15, the defendant, Mr. Will Powers, killed fellow actor Jack Hammer at Studio One of Global Studios. It is impossible for anyone else to have committed this heinous crime. The evidence presented during the trial will all point to this fact.
First, I would like to call a familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand.
Detective, if you would briefly describe this case to the court?
Your Honor. This case is quite simple if you ask one question: And that question is: "What did the security lady at the guard station see?"
Let's call this security officer to the stand!
Will the witness declare her name?
Y-your name, please!
YOUR NAME, PLEASE!
O-objection! I... object to the witness's talkativeness.
Perhaps we can get to the testimony?
Was there anyone at the studios when you arrived at the guard station?
If there was a run-through in the morning, why did you only get there after noon?
Tell us what happened next.
...
Um, yeah. ... Umm... well. I wonder?
Huh!?
The prosecution would like to ask the old... the witness. Please make known all the information in your possession ahead of time!
...
Mr. Wright! Please, for all our sakes, try not to upset the witness!
You may continue your testimony.
Yes, but only Mr. Powers would have been dragging his leg!
I think we've heard enough! Haven't we, Your Honor?
Which is?
Umm... hmm. Actually, well... We couldn't find it. We're looking, though.
Anyway, that's not important! The witness did see the Steel Samurai, yes. And it is clear that the person in the Steel Samurai suit was Mr. Will Powers!
Then allow me to remove that doubt from your mind, Your Honor...
Most perceptive, Your Honor!
Will the witness continue her testimony, please?
The witness has answered the question! Anyone going into the studio had to pass by the witness!
...
Huh!? B-believe me, I want to, but I don't know what this means either.
M-Ms. Oldbag! This is the first I've heard of this!
Do you backup all of the security camera data?
Do you backup all of the security camera data?
A boy in 2nd or 3rd grade? Hmm... I assume it would be hard, if not impossible for a young boy to wield the Samurai Spear?
The prosecution's thoughts are simple. Nothing has changed. The other person who went to the studios was a boy of roughly 10 years of age. The photo we do have may not be hard evidence... But there is still no one else that could have committed this crime! I call for a verdict of "guilty" for the defendant, Mr. Will Powers!
If you're serious, you've got guts, Mr. Wright. Remember the photo? Wasn't the Steel Samurai a little lame!? He was dragging his foot!
Remember the testimony concerning Powers's injury!!!
The assistant knew nothing of Mr. Power's injury! She could look the Steel Samurai look with that costume... But she couldn't walk the the Steel Samurai walk! She wouldn't have limped!
Bah! Are you seriously suggesting the boy did it, Mr. Wright!? "Grade-school boy kills veteran action star with spear!" For one thing, it was the Steel Samurai holding the murder weapon. Would you care to explain just how the boy was involved?
... The prosecution has no meaningful objections at this time.
Something "Oldbag," Your Honor.
By whom!?
Why didn't I hear about this!?
We should have known something was fishy! How could they have done a run-through of their action scene without a director? Of course!
Where!
*grumble* (I'll kill this woman, I swear it...)
We should have known something was fishy! How could they have done a run-through of their action scene without a director? Of course!
Where!
... I understand, Your Honor.
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.
An unexpected fact has come to the attention of the court. Yesterday, we learned that there were other people present at the studios! Today, I would like to show evidence proving they had nothing to do with the murder.
The prosecution calls Mr. Sal Manella to the stand.
Will the witness state his name and profession?
...
Tell us more about that.
Everyone else meaning that the witness did not eat with them.
Heh heh heh...
...
To eat a t-bone steak in 15 minutes... that's quite a feat.
Leads to:
Haven't we had enough of this pointless line of questioning? Your Honor! The testimony to this point has made one certain fact painfully clear: The people in the trailer had nothing to do with this murder! It was impossible for any of them to go to Studio One!
Something wrong, Mr. Wright? Surely you aren't suggesting one of the people in the trailer went to Studio One!
Tsk, tsk, tsk... Never a dull moment with you, Mr. Wright!
You've been doing your homework, haven't you? Look at the Court Record.
Surely, you knew that from 2:15 to 4:00 the path between the studios was blocked? Mrs. Monkey's head had fallen across the path!
True, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way!
Ha hah! I thought you might be thoughtlessly treading on thin ice again! But I see you had at least an inkling of the truth.
It's quite simple... True, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way! At around 2:15, a strong gust of wind knocked off the studio mascot's head. Ergo! When the people in the trailer took a break at 2:30, the way to the studio was blocked. Blocked... by Mrs. Monkey's severed head!
I believe we have seen enough evidence. I would like to relieve Mr. Manella from the stand.
Your Honor. The prosecution is pleased to announce that we indeed have decisive evidence: a witness.
My witness saw the very moment when the Steel Samurai skewered the victim!
The prosecution has a concern. As our witness is a grade schooler of tender years, and this is a murder case... We worry that the defense might cause unnecessary trauma with his cruel questioning!
However, we have no choice. The prosecution calls Cody Hackins to the stand.
Your Honor. Perhaps you could arrange a box for him to stand on?
Will the witness state his name and grade in school.
Witness!
Mrph...
M-mrrrrph! Witness! Er, I mean, Cody.
You were present, er, you were at Global Studios on the day of the, er, incident?
Please tell us what you saw that day.
Just.. Mr. Edgeworth will be fine.
M-mpht! M-my apologies, Your Honor. He said he wouldn't testify if he couldn't bring it... I'd like special permission, if that's possible.
Right, right. Please continue.
...
So you went straight to the studio?
Mr. Wright! How cruel you are, to terrorize a poor child so!
What do you mean "or a prosecuting attorney"!?
He's getting to that! Relax and listen.
I see. And what happened next?
What is the meaning of this? The witness has stated what he saw quite clearly...
M-mmph!
Just a moment, please... One thing has become quite clear in this boy's testimony. He did not believe he was witnessing a murder! He was watching the Steel Samurai fight, like on TV. The more real the fight, the more he would have watched!
Probably?
Mr. Wright, explain yourself! What could possibly distract this boy from seeing his idol, the Steel Samurai, fight!? What do you claim he was looking at?
Hah! Lost your nerve, have you?
I'm "Mr. Edgeworth."
What kind of stunt are you trying to pull, Wright!? The Steel Samurai was the murderer, not the victim!
An... error? What's this all about!?
...
Okay, Wright! First you're right, now you're wrong!? Which is it!?
If you're so sure, then tell us what it is!
... Sorry. I was too shocked to say anything for a bit there. Listen, Wright! Only one person died in this incident, and that is Jack Hammer! Yet now you claim there "was no victim"? Are you insane?
Okay, Wright! First you're right, now you're wrong!? Which is it!?
If you're so sure, then tell us what it is!
...
Show us, quick!
Wright! This is no time for daydreaming and pointless pontification! Think about your client, and us, who are forced to listen to your rambling!
Aaaaaah!
B-but... Th-that's impossible!
This is madness! Jack Hammer is the victim! The victim! Why would he steal a Steel Samurai costume!? Are you suggesting he did so to cover up the details of his own murder!?
Or do you have proof!? Give me proof that the victim, Jack Hammer, stole the costume!
Y-you do!?
This much time after the day of the murder!? Even if there were traces it still proves nothing! No blood test could tell that Hammer was the one who drugged him, Mr. Wright!
Hmm...
Mm?
As you say, Your Honor.
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.
In yesterday's session, the defense presented us with a new theory for this case. He claims that the scene of the crime was, in fact, Studio Two. Today, I will call on people present in the Studio Two trailer that day. From their testimonies, the truth will become clear.
The prosecution calls Ms. Dee Vasquez to the stand. Ms. Dee Vasquez is a producer who was present in the Studio Two trailer that day.
Will the witness state her name and occupation?
On the day of the murder, you were in the trailer in Studio Two...
...?
Mrrph!
The witness did not come here to engage in idle conversation! Stop interrupting the testimony.
Mmph!
The meeting ended at 4:00, and the rehearsal was scheduled for 5:00... I would think it was between those times.
Yeah! Mr. Wright...! Oops.
Mr. Wright. Need I remind you it was a T-BONE STEAK!?
What kind of stunt are you trying to pull, Wright!?
Well, maybe it's not impossible, but--
Mmmph!
Y-yeah! Take that, Wright! If you still think she did it, show us proof!
What’s this? You're taking back your claim?
You "don't know"!? What kind of a lawyer are you!?
M-m-mmph!
B-but, that IS the murder weapon!
Mr. Wright! What are you driving at!? Think about what you're--
Mmmph...!
Can the antics, Wright!
What does this have to do with the current case!?
Wh... what!? Are you saying...!?
I-in other words... th-the victim, Mr. Hammer... He died in the same way that he caused another man to die... five years ago!
The break in the meeting at the trailer lasted 15 minutes, from 2:30 to 2:45. Could Jack Hammer have been pushed off the stairs to his death... then carried to Studio One and placed inside his costume? There wasn’t enough time!
If you claim she did everything in 15 minutes...
Correct! Show me proof!
Then I won't have you making any unsubstantiated claims!
Hah! I need only look at the cold sweat running down your face to know what you're thinking!
Hold on, Wright! Don't forget, it was Sal Manella that drove the van! Are you suggesting that Mr. Manella was a conspirator?
Hah! So, without Mr. Manella noticing anything, she put the body in the van... Then managed to put the body into the costume...? Are you seriously suggesting that is possible!?
Ha... hah!?
Li..light... Lighten!? Y-you can't lighten up a murder!
...
...
Umm... uhh... mmmph. O-of course, it's as the witness says! ... Certainly, it does seem very likely she did it... but, uh, there's no proof!
...
I was hoping I'd come up with a question while I was objecting, Your Honor... I didn't.
Your Honor! I request that the witness testify again!
I... I just want to hear your testimony again.
Mmmph! Well, yes, um... ... Indeed! Verily, I say... Ergo! I want to hear about what happened... after they found the body!
...
Your Honor!!! I have an objection to the witness's last statement!
Think! Ms. Vasquez said she didn't bring the script because there wouldn't be a rehearsal. Don't you see what that means? She would have had to know about the murder before going to Studio One!
...
... I... appreciate the concern, Your Honor. I will stand by my statement, however, regardless of how the court sees my role here. Now, Ms. Vasquez... Do you have an explanation?
Well... It would have been after he put on the Steel Samurai costume... and went to Studio Two. Where he was murdered!
Witness! Can you refute this claim?
His guilt weighed him down, no doubt.
Bringing us to the present day... and Mr. Hammer's last role as the Evil Magistrate!
Hmm...
What's that now!?
Wha-!? WHAT!?
In the waiting lobby, Your Honor. As calm and collected as ever...
I think not, Your Honor. Will Powers was innocent. That he should be found so is only natural... not a miracle.
...
... Say something, Wright. I'm not good at small talk.
You don't waste any time gloating, do you?
Ah, er, Edgeworth. I'm a big fan of your work, Mr. Powers.
... Wright. I must say, I hadn't expected to meet you again after all these years.
However. In retrospect, it would have been better had we not met. Thanks to you, I am saddled with unnecessary... feelings.
Yes. Unease... and uncertainty.
They only serve to get in my way. You listen to me, Phoenix Wright. Don't ever show your face in front of me again. That's what I came here to tell you.
